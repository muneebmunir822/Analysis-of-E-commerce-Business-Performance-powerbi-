**Analysis of E-commerce Business Performance**


This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the business performance and operational activities of a major Brazilian e-commerce company. The study utilizes a relational database containing activities recorded from September 2016 to August 2018.


**📊 Dataset Overview**
The analysis is built upon several interlinked tables to provide a holistic view of the business:


Orders: Customer IDs, order status, and detailed fulfillment timestamps.


Order Items: Links orders to products, prices, shipping costs, and seller IDs.


Payment Info: Transaction values, payment modes, and installment details.


Customers & Sellers: Geographic lookups including city and state information.



Products: Details on categories, names, and physical attributes.


Reviews: Customer satisfaction scores on a 1–5 scale.

**📈 Key Business Insights**
Executive Summary

Revenue Growth: The company shows a significant positive year-over-year growth pattern.



Black Friday Impact: Total order value peaked in November 2017, likely driven by Black Friday.


Market Concentration: Customers are heavily concentrated in the Southeast, with just three states (SP, RJ, MG) representing 66.51% of all orders.


Retention Challenge: While there are nearly 100,000 active customers, almost 100% are one-time purchasers.

Product & Category Analysis

Volume vs. Margin: "Bed_bath_table" leads in sales volume, whereas "Computers" is the margin leader with an average price of $1,098.


Visual Impact: There is a positive correlation between the number of product photos and sales volume.


Price Sensitivity: Sales count drops drastically as products move into "Very High" price ranges.

**Operations & Logistics**

Delivery Gap: Southern states enjoy quick shipping, while Northern states like Roraima (RR) and Amapá (AP) average over 25 days.


Reliability: The overall On-Time Delivery Rate is 92.0%, leaving approximately 7,826 orders delivered late.



**💡 Strategic Recommendations**

Retention Strategy: Shift marketing budget from "new user acquisition" to "re-engagement campaigns" (e.g., email discounts for second purchases).


Logistics Intervention: Perform root cause analysis for carriers in the North/Northeast and collaborate with local providers to reduce delivery times.


VIP Tiering: Develop a loyalty program specifically targeting "Whale" clientele (high-spenders generating maximum revenue).


Operational Priority: Prioritize improving delivery speeds over cutting prices, as customers penalize delivery delays more harshly than they reward low costs.
